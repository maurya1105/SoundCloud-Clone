            <p class="by_tracy">By Tracy Chan (10/13/22)</p>
            <img class="SOUNDCLOUD_art" src="/images/soundcloud_artist.jpg" alt="SOUNDCLOUD_art">
            <p class="today">Today, we are excited to launch SoundCloud for Artists – an elevated, all-in-one <br> platform for artists to connect with fans and accelerate their careers. SoundCloud <br> for Artists is now your centralized home for all things distribution, promotion, <br> monetization, and more.</p>
            <p class="at_soundcloud">At SoundCloud, we’ve driving a more equitable and exciting future for ALL artists.</p>
            <p class="soundcloud">SoundCloud continues to be a creator-first company, focusing on what artists <br> need to build their careers and thrive. We believe that artists, producers, and <br> songwriters are the driving force that continues to push what’s Next. We believe <br> that what’s next isn’t determined by algorithms and gatekeepers, but that the true <br> path toward a long and successful career is best achieved by cultivating deep fan <br> relationships and community. We believe that artists should be rewarded directly <br> by their fans, so we launched Fan-Powered Royalties, a revolutionary new model <br> that allows artists to be paid based on fans' actual listening habits.</p>
            <p class="with">With the launch of <strong>SoundCloud for Artists</strong> , we're now doubling down on our <br> commitment to these beliefs to lead what’s next in music.</p>
